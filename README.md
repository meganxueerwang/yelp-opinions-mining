Opinion Mining over the Yelp Challenge Dataset
--------

This system induces a set of extractions, which are in the form of attribute-value pairs, from restaurant reviews. Attributes are features of the restaurant discussed in the review (e.g. chicken, service, atmosphere) and values are descriptors of the attributes (e.g. delicious, fast, romantic). Each value has an associated polarity (how positive or negative it is). Attributes are clustered into five categories: Food, Service, Decor, Overall, and Other.
